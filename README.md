# Sorting Techniques

### 1. **Bubble Sort**
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Bubble Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 2. **Selection Sort**
Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Selection Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 3. **Insertion Sort**
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works similarly to the way you might sort playing cards in your hands. It picks elements one by one and places them in the correct position.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Insertion Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 4. **Merge Sort**
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It is known for its consistent performance.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Merge Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

### 5. **Quick Sort**
Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays. It recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Quick Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) on average, O(nÂ²) in the worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)

---

### 6. **Heap Sort**
Heap Sort uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a max heap from the array, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Heap Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 7. **Counting Sort**
Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each element in the array and then uses this count to place elements in the sorted order.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Counting Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-elements/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k), where k is the range of the numbers
- **Space Complexity**: O(k)

---

### 8. **Radix Sort**
Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm. It processes the numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant one.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Radix Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nk), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)

---

### 9. **Bucket Sort**
Bucket Sort divides the array into several "buckets" and then sorts each bucket individually. It is most effective when the input is uniformly distributed over a range.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Bucket Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of buckets
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)

---

### 10. **Tim Sort**
Tim Sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. It is the default sorting algorithm in Python and Java.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Tim Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

### 11. **Shell Sort**
Shell Sort is a generalized version of Insertion Sort. It allows the exchange of items that are far apart, reducing the total number of swaps compared to regular Insertion Sort.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Shell Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (depending on the gap sequence)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 12. **Cocktail Shaker Sort**
Cocktail Shaker Sort is a variation of Bubble Sort. It sorts in both directions on each pass through the list, improving performance by reducing the number of passes.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Cocktail Shaker Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 13. **Gnome Sort**
Gnome Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that is similar to Insertion Sort but with a different approach. It moves an element backward if it is larger than the previous one.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Gnome Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

### 14. **Pigeonhole Sort**
Pigeonhole Sort is similar to Counting Sort. It sorts by determining the number of "pigeonholes" (buckets) based on the range of the elements and placing them in the correct holes.

- **LeetCode Problem**: [Pigeonhole Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + N), where n is the number of elements and N is the range of numbers
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + N)
